|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reactivity Model**              | Declarative UI updates using the Virtual DOM. State and props trigger component updates.    | Reactivity system with a Proxy-based implementation for fine-grained reactivity.       |
| **Rendering Performance**         | Automatic batching for updates to reduce renders.                                           | Reactive rendering with fine-grained dependency tracking for minimal re-renders.       |

### Why These Features Are Useful in Nuxt

#### **Cookie Utilities in Nuxt**
- Nuxt provides built-in utilities to manage cookies both on the client and server, which simplifies authentication, session management, and persistent data storage.  
- Developers donâ€™t need to install third-party libraries for basic cookie functionality, reducing dependency overhead and improving security.

#### **Module System in Nuxt**
- Nuxtâ€™s module system allows developers to easily integrate functionality like analytics, SEO, or PWA support without manually setting up configurations.  
- Modules streamline adding and maintaining features by providing pre-built, extensible functionality that works out of the box.  
- Examples of popular Nuxt modules include:
  - `@nuxtjs/axios` for HTTP requests  
  - `@nuxtjs/auth-next` for authentication  
  - `@nuxt/image` for optimized image handling  

In comparison, Next.js requires more manual setup for cookies and lacks a native module system, which can make implementing some features more time-consuming.

### Why Built-in State Management in Nuxt is Useful

#### **Seamless State Management**
- In Nuxt, `useState` provides a simple and intuitive API for managing both client-side and server-side state.  
- Developers donâ€™t need to install or configure external libraries like Redux, Zustand, or Recoil, making state management straightforward and integrated.

#### **Unified State Across Client and Server**
- Nuxtâ€™s `useState` allows maintaining shared state between the server and client without additional boilerplate.  
- This is particularly useful for SSR and universal applications where state needs to persist seamlessly across rendering modes.

In contrast, Next.js requires third-party libraries for state management, which can increase complexity and setup time. This makes Nuxt a more out-of-the-box solution for projects that need straightforward state management.

You can also find Lighthouse report performed on the same machine, both of solution respect Google Web Vitals. Next as a built-in support for GZIP compression for HTML therefore we do it manually inside [Nuxt](./nuxt-version/server/plugins/gzip.ts)
