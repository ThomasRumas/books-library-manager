## React and Vue comparaison

| Feature                           | React 19                                                                                      | Vue 3                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reactivity Model**              | Declarative UI updates using the Virtual DOM. State and props trigger component updates.    | Reactivity system with a Proxy-based implementation for fine-grained reactivity.       |
| **Rendering Performance**         | Automatic batching for updates to reduce renders.                                           | Reactive rendering with fine-grained dependency tracking for minimal re-renders.       |

### Why These Features Are Useful in Nuxt

#### **Cookie Utilities in Nuxt**
- Nuxt provides built-in utilities to manage cookies both on the client and server, which simplifies authentication, session management, and persistent data storage.  
- Developers donâ€™t need to install third-party libraries for basic cookie functionality, reducing dependency overhead and improving security.

#### **Module System in Nuxt**
- Nuxtâ€™s module system allows developers to easily integrate functionality like analytics, SEO, or PWA support without manually setting up configurations.  
- Modules streamline adding and maintaining features by providing pre-built, extensible functionality that works out of the box.  
- Examples of popular Nuxt modules include:
  - `@nuxtjs/axios` for HTTP requests  
  - `@nuxtjs/auth-next` for authentication  
  - `@nuxt/image` for optimized image handling  

In comparison, Next.js requires more manual setup for cookies and lacks a native module system, which can make implementing some features more time-consuming.

### Why Built-in State Management in Nuxt is Useful

#### **Seamless State Management**
- In Nuxt, `useState` provides a simple and intuitive API for managing both client-side and server-side state.  
- Developers donâ€™t need to install or configure external libraries like Redux, Zustand, or Recoil, making state management straightforward and integrated.

#### **Unified State Across Client and Server**
- Nuxtâ€™s `useState` allows maintaining shared state between the server and client without additional boilerplate.  
- This is particularly useful for SSR and universal applications where state needs to persist seamlessly across rendering modes.

In contrast, Next.js requires third-party libraries for state management, which can increase complexity and setup time. This makes Nuxt a more out-of-the-box solution for projects that need straightforward state management.

## Web Performance comparaison

| Asset Type  | Nuxt (without compression) | Nuxt (GZIP)   | Next (GZIP)   |
|-------------|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **DOM**     | 177 KB                     | 24.2KB        | 4.2 KB        |
| **CSS**     | -                          | 15.7 KB       | 25.3 KB       |
| **JS**      | -                          | 93.4 KB       | 120 KB        |

You can also find Lighthouse report performed on the same machine, both of solution respect Google Web Vitals. Next as a built-in support for GZIP compression for HTML therefore we do it manually inside [Nuxt](./nuxt-version/server/plugins/gzip.ts) 

##Â State of JS 2024

We will know compare last results of [State of JS Survey](https://2024.stateofjs.com/) about theses two frameworks and theses two meta-framework. 

### React 

React is still the one most used worldwide with a result of 82%, this score is stable since 3 years. Globally all the technical stack based on React is remaining alive. But when we've got a look interest, it continually to slown down to 34% this year, in 2022 the score was 47%! 
If we are now looking for the retention of developers on this stack, it's also stable since last year, and we've got a score of 75%. 

### VueJS 

VueJS is still the second framework used on the market with a usage of 51%, the same result as 2021, we can be agree, like React, that projects made with Vue are still alive. Also the interest of VueJS still remained the same since 2021 with a score of 48%. But there is growth in VueJS retention of 12%, passing from 75% to 87%, it's an interesting growth for a framework available since 8 years on the survey! 

### NextJS (React)

If we are looking about NextJS, it's still the meta framework the most used worldwide with 54% scoring, but interest fell by 22 points in 2 years from 65% to 43% in 2024! If we have a look on the retention it have the same tendancy, passing from 89% in 2022 to 68% in 2024. Therefore Vercel continues to improve their framework, interest and retention are going down quickly. 

### Nuxt (Vue)

Like VueJS, Nuxt is the second on the market with a usage of 22%, the Nuxt interest seems stable since 2020, it only lost 8% since, passing from 47% to 39%, but when it's interesting, the retention has grown a litle from last year, winning 5 points to be now 81%.
